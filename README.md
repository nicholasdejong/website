# Personal Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal website.
The website is built with React and NextJS. I initially wanted to build it with Rust (making use of `tide`), but then tried Svelte, found it lacking the power I wanted, and now here we are.

My to-do list for my website:
- [ ] Add a blog (preferably written in markdown, hence the `.md` support)
- [ ] Add the portfolio page
- [ ] Add the about me page
- [ ] Add the contact page
- [ ] Finish, Document and include my first project (big!!)
